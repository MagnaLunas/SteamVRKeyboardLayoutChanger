# SteamVRKeyboardLayoutChanger
Change your SteamVR keyboard layout :)

### How to use:
1. Press the language button below the keyboard.
2. Enjoy :)

### Compatible with 1.27.x only. **May not work on SteamVR Beta**.

### How to install:
Copy files into (**SteamVR\resources\webinterface\dashboard**) folder.

If you need certain languages in the layout, modify **layout_base_overlay.json** as you wish.

Clean your SteamVR cache (Remove **%localappdata%\SteamVR\htmlcache\Cache** folder).

(Optional) Mark **keyboard.js** and **layout_base_overlay.json** as read-only so you don't lose your changes after a SteamVR update.
